print(x)

# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "Isaac"
y = 'Name'
name = 'Helen'
name = "Helen"
flower = 'tulip'
flower = "tulip"

# variables can be called anything EXCEPT for keywords: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp
# successfully installed Homebrew !
# failure to set Python 3.8 as default

# snake case
name_flower = "tulip"
name_son = "Isaac"
# variables should be lower case; the only time things are upper case is when it's a Class or when it's a boolean value

# Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# Illegal variable names:
# 2myvar = "John"
myvar = "John"
myvar = "John"

# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print("Hello World") 

print("Hello World")

#this is an error message for wrong print
# print(Hello World)
#                 ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
