# lab on variables
x = "Isaac"  # x is now type of str
print(x)

# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "Isaac"
y = 'Name'
name = 'Helen'
name = "Helen"
flower = 'tulip'
flower = "tulip"

# variables can be called anything EXCEPT for keywords: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp
